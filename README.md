# GPS RINEX Reader
This repository contains MATLAB code written by A-Talebifard for reading GPS data from a RINEX file.
The code reads in a RINEX file using the uigetfile function, and then extracts GPS data from the file using the GPSfileread function.
The extracted data is stored in a table format.

## Getting Started
To use this code, you will need MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download MATLAB from the MathWorks website â†—.
